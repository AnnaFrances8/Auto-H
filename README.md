# Auto-H ⚙️

## Requirements 🛠️
Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Helicon focus 8.2.2.

``` python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage Instructions 🚀
**Helicon Focus 8.2.2**: This button automates the image stacking process using the Helicon Focus 8.2.2 program, which you must have installed. After selecting the directory containing all the folders, the computer will handle the task automatically.
There is no connection between AUTO-H and Helicon focus. AUTO-H is intended to be a tool for the automatization of the process in order to increase the number of processed images, but the stacking process is entirely made by the existing no-related program Helicon focus. 

**Change folder name**: In our lab's case, the folders are saved by default with a prefix and a sufix. This tool can delate them and rename the folder. In order to do that it is important to save as follows: name+

Example: REM_96_2042-1-200x-dic+

Remember that every folder needs to have its own name.

**Final name**: set to the stacked image the same name as the folder.

**New folder**: create an 'OUTPUT' folder where all the stacked and well-named images will be stored together. (continues)

In each button you will need to select the directory.
